          <h3>Legacy code refactoring</h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              I've spent most of my career understanding, refactoring,
              and extending legacy code, and I really love it! I pride myself in
              being able to improve my team's efficiency by taking care of the
              sticky bits of legacy code they'd rather not touch. This includes
              setting up tests in highly coupled parts of the code and pairing
              with other developers to boost their confidence in dealing
              with legacy code.

          <h3>Mentoring</h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              I believe in each person's unique skills. I've instilled
              a culture of mentorship and respect in my teams by proactively
              offering help and giving feedback. In my free time, I mentor
              junior developers on testing, object oriented design,
              or anywhere their having trouble at.
            </p>

          <h3>Product strategy</h3>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              I take ownership of products I work on and give advice on which
              direction to take based on my vast experience with startups.
              I know what has succeeded and what has failed.
